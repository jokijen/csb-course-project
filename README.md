## Testing the application

Take the following steps to test the application, but be mindful that the app is not secure in its current state: 

1. Clone the repository to a location of your choice and go to its root directory
3. Create a virtual environment: $ python3 -m venv venv
4. Activate the virtual environment: $ source venv/bin/activate
5. Install necessary packages using pip: $ pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run migrations: $ python3 manage.py migrate
7. Run the application: $ python3 manage.py runserver
8. Add new users, login, and send messages
